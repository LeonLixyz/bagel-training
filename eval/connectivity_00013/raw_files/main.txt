QUESTION:
Is the undirected graph connected? [problem_image_1]

REASONING TRACE:
Algorithm: Checking connectivity via breadth-first traversal starting at node 0. In a connected graph, we should be able to reach all nodes from any starting node.
Color key: Unvisited nodes are gray. The current node being processed is gold. Previously visited nodes are medium purple. Newly discovered neighbors are yellow.
We'll explore the graph layer by layer using BFS and track visited nodes.
Step 1: Processing node 0 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. We found 2 unvisited neighbors: {1, 6}. These will be explored in subsequent steps. Visited set is now {0} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [6, 1]. So far we've explored 1 out of 8 nodes (12%). [reasoning_image_1]
Step 2: Processing node 6 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. We found 1 unvisited neighbors: {3}. These will be explored in subsequent steps. Visited set is now {0, 6} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [1, 3]. So far we've explored 2 out of 8 nodes (25%). [reasoning_image_2]
Step 3: Processing node 1 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. We found 2 unvisited neighbors: {2, 5}. These will be explored in subsequent steps. Visited set is now {0, 1, 6} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [3, 5, 2]. So far we've explored 3 out of 8 nodes (37%). [reasoning_image_3]
Step 4: Processing node 3 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. No new unvisited neighbors found from this node. Visited set is now {0, 1, 3, 6} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [5, 2]. So far we've explored 4 out of 8 nodes (50%). [reasoning_image_4]
Step 5: Processing node 5 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. We found 2 unvisited neighbors: {4, 7}. These will be explored in subsequent steps. Visited set is now {0, 1, 3, 5, 6} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [2, 4, 7]. So far we've explored 5 out of 8 nodes (62%). [reasoning_image_5]
Step 6: Processing node 2 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. No new unvisited neighbors found from this node. Visited set is now {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [4, 7]. So far we've explored 6 out of 8 nodes (75%). [reasoning_image_6]
Step 7: Processing node 4 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. No new unvisited neighbors found from this node. Visited set is now {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [7]. So far we've explored 7 out of 8 nodes (87%). [reasoning_image_7]
Step 8: Processing node 7 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. No new unvisited neighbors found from this node. Visited set is now {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: []. So far we've explored 8 out of 8 nodes (100%). [reasoning_image_8]
Conclusion: The graph is connected. We were able to visit all 8 nodes starting from a single node (0), proving there is a path from our starting node to every other node in the graph.
Final solution: The graph is yes connected. All nodes are reachable from each other. [reasoning_image_9]

FINAL ANSWER:
Yes
