      "system_prompt": "You are an expert in creating clean and logically coherent multimodal chain of thought traces. Your task is to analyze\nand comprehend a raw reasoning trace with interleaved text and images, then transform it into a clean, step-by-step multimodal\nreasoning trace that correctly solves the original problem.\n\n========================  INPUT  ========================\n1. Problem & Noisy Trace: A raw interleaved text and image reasoning trace. Images in this trace are represented by placeholders:\n   - `[problem_image_X]` for original problem images (e.g., `[problem_image_1]`, `[problem_image_2]`)\n   - `[reasoning_image_X]` for images generated during reasoning (e.g., `[reasoning_image_1]`, `[reasoning_image_2]`)\n2. Image Data: The actual image data corresponding to the placeholders, provided separately.\n\n=====================  Your Task  =================\nGenerate a clean, logical multimodal reasoning trace as **plain text** that represents the *ideal* reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n=====================  OUTPUT FORMAT  ===================\nYou MUST generate the formatted reasoning trace with the following structure:\n\nQUESTION:\n<The original problem statement with text and image placeholders: <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>, <image_start>[problem_image_2]<image_end>, etc. Stay as close to the original problem statement as possible but remove noise to ensure clarity>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: <Clear description of initial reasoning step that identifies key elements of the problem>\nTHOUGHT 1: <Next reasoning step, often explaining why an image will be created>\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: <Further reasoning step based on the image, explaining insights gained>\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\n// Additional thoughts and images as needed\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_X]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT N: <Final reasoning step before the answer, summarizing key insights>\n\nFINAL ANSWER: \n<The final calculated answer based on the reasoning>\n\n=====================  Guidelines  =================\n\n1. Enhancing Original Trace Rather than Generating New Trace:\n  - Instead of generating a new trace, your task is to enhance the original trace (which is a correct trace but rather concise and lacks coherent multimodal reasoning) by adding more details and explanations, see the following sections of guidelines for more details.\n  - You MUST use all the images provided in the original trace.\n  - You should use the original trace as a reference rather than copying it verbatim.\n\n2. Multimodal Reasoning Flow:\n   - Develop a coherent, step-by-step chain of thought that seamlessly integrates textual and visual reasoning.\n   - Clearly explain the necessity of generating a sketch / visual thought / image before introducing its placeholder.\n   - After each image placeholder, describe the insights gained from the sketch / visual thought / image, and how it contributes to advancing the solution.\n   - Ensure each step logically builds on the previous ones, especially between text reasoning and visual reasoning\n   steps. \n   \n3. Image Placeholders and References:\n   - Use placeholder tags ONLY when you want to actually insert/show/generate an image in your trace. When doing so, write the corresponding placeholder tag exactly as shown, including the <image_start> and <image_end> tags.\n   - Each unique image in the original problem and the reasoning trace should be represented by a unique placeholder tag, and each unique placeholder tag should only show up once in the trace.\n   - When referring to images in your explanations, use natural language descriptions (e.g., \"the diagram in the question\", \"the first sketch\", \"the visual thought X I created\") instead of using placeholder tags. This is important because it helps us to parse into interleaved text and image sequences.\n   - For images from the original problem, use: <image_start>[problem_image_X]<image_end>\n   - For sketches or visuals generated during reasoning, use: <image_start>[reasoning_image_X]<image_end>\n\n4. Narrative Style:\n   - Remove irrelevant technical details such as debugging info, code snippets, and LaTeX package imports.\n   - Eliminate verbose language that do not contribute to solving the problem.\n   - Focus on the essential reasoning path that leads to the correct solution, using concise and clear language to describe the overall reasoning process.\n\n"

      "text": "QUESTION:\nIs the undirected graph connected? [problem_image_1]\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nAlgorithm: Checking connectivity via breadth-first traversal starting at node 0. In a connected graph, we should be able to reach all nodes from any starting node.\nColor key: Unvisited nodes are gray. The current node being processed is gold. Previously visited nodes are medium purple. Newly discovered neighbors are yellow.\nWe'll explore the graph layer by layer using BFS and track visited nodes.\nStep 1: Processing node 0 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. We found 2 unvisited neighbors: {3, 4}. These will be explored in subsequent steps. Visited set is now {0} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [3, 4]. So far we've explored 1 out of 5 nodes (20%). [reasoning_image_1]\nStep 2: Processing node 3 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. No new unvisited neighbors found from this node. Visited set is now {0, 3} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: [4]. So far we've explored 2 out of 5 nodes (40%). [reasoning_image_2]\nStep 3: Processing node 4 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. No new unvisited neighbors found from this node. Visited set is now {0, 3, 4} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: []. So far we've explored 3 out of 5 nodes (60%). [reasoning_image_3]\nConclusion: The graph is not connected. We only visited 3 out of 5 nodes starting from node 0. This means there are 2 nodes that cannot be reached from our starting point, indicating the graph has multiple disconnected components.\nFinal solution: The graph is no connected. Only nodes {0, 3, 4} are reachable from the starting node 0. [reasoning_image_4]\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nNo\n\n\n"
