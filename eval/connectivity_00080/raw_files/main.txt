QUESTION:
Is the undirected graph connected? [problem_image_1]

REASONING TRACE:
Algorithm: Checking connectivity via breadth-first traversal starting at node 0. In a connected graph, we should be able to reach all nodes from any starting node.
Color key: Unvisited nodes are gray. The current node being processed is gold. Previously visited nodes are medium purple. Newly discovered neighbors are tomato red.
We'll explore the graph layer by layer using BFS and track visited nodes.
Step 1: Processing node 0 (colored gold). We mark it as visited and explore all its neighbors. No new unvisited neighbors found from this node. Visited set is now {0} (colored medium purple). Queue for future exploration: []. So far we've explored 1 out of 5 nodes (20%). [reasoning_image_1]
Conclusion: The graph is not connected. We only visited 1 out of 5 nodes starting from node 0. This means there are 4 nodes that cannot be reached from our starting point, indicating the graph has multiple disconnected components.
Final solution: The graph is no connected. Only nodes {0} are reachable from the starting node 0. [reasoning_image_2]

FINAL ANSWER:
No
