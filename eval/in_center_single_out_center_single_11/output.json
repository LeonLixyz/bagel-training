  "response": "QUESTION:\nDetermine the pattern that should replace the question mark in the 3x3 grid shown in the image, selecting from the provided answer options.\n<image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: The problem presents a 3x3 matrix of images. Each image appears to be composed of an outer shape and an inner shape, suggesting two independent patterns to analyze.\nTHOUGHT 1: First, examine the outer shapes in each row and column. The outer shape in the third row follows a pattern where it becomes a square. A visual representation helps clarify this.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: Next, analyze the inner shapes. The inner shape in the third row follows a pattern where it becomes a dark triangle pointing down. A visual representation helps clarify this.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: Combining the identified outer square and inner dark downward triangle, the missing image should be a dark downward triangle inside a square. This matches answer option 2.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nThe answer is option 2",
