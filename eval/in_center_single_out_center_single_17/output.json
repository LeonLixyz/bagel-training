  "response": "QUESTION:\nWhich pattern should replace the question mark in the 3x3 grid shown, based on the patterns in the other cells? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: Examine the 3x3 grid to identify patterns in the shapes and their components. There appears to be a pattern involving the outer shape and the inner shape/color.\nTHOUGHT 1: Let's analyze the outer shapes in the third row. The first cell has a pentagon, the second has a hexagon. Following the sequence from the first two rows, the outer shape in the third cell should be a circle.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: The sketch confirms the outer shape for the missing cell is a circle based on the row pattern. Now, let's look at the inner shapes and their fill color in the third row.\nTHOUGHT 3: The inner shapes in the third row are a white pentagon and a dark pentagon. The pattern in the first two rows suggests the inner shape alternates between a white and dark pentagon.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 4: The second sketch shows the combined outer circle and inner dark pentagon, following the patterns identified in the third row. This matches answer option 3.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nThe answer is option 3",
