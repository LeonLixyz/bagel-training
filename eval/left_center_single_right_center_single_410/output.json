  "response": "QUESTION:\nWhat pattern should replace the question mark in the 3x3 grid shown in the image, selecting from the provided answer options? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: The problem presents a 3x3 grid where each cell contains two shapes separated by a vertical line. We need to find the missing cell in the third row.\nTHOUGHT 1: Let's analyze the pattern of the objects on the left side of the vertical line in the third row. The shapes are Hexagon, Pentagon, Circle, Square. Following a sequence of decreasing sides or a specific order, the next shape should be a Triangle. <image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: The image shows a grey left-pointing triangle, which fits the pattern for the left object in the third row. Now, let's analyze the objects on the right side. In the third row, the shapes are Pentagon (black), Circle (dark grey), Square (grey). The next shape should be a grey triangle. The answer options show a downward-pointing triangle. <image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: The image shows the predicted left object (grey left-pointing triangle) and the predicted right object (grey downward-pointing triangle). Combining these, the missing panel should contain a grey left-pointing triangle on the left and a grey downward-pointing triangle on the right.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nThe answer is option 8",
