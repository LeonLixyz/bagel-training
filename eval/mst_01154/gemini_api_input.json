      "system_prompt": "You are an expert in creating clean and logically coherent multimodal chain of thought traces. Your task is to analyze\nand comprehend a raw reasoning trace with interleaved text and images, then transform it into a clean, step-by-step multimodal\nreasoning trace that correctly solves the original problem.\n\n========================  INPUT  ========================\n1. Problem & Noisy Trace: A raw interleaved text and image reasoning trace. Images in this trace are represented by placeholders:\n   - `[problem_image_X]` for original problem images (e.g., `[problem_image_1]`, `[problem_image_2]`)\n   - `[reasoning_image_X]` for images generated during reasoning (e.g., `[reasoning_image_1]`, `[reasoning_image_2]`)\n2. Image Data: The actual image data corresponding to the placeholders, provided separately.\n\n=====================  Your Task  =================\nGenerate a clean, logical multimodal reasoning trace as **plain text** that represents the *ideal* reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n=====================  OUTPUT FORMAT  ===================\nYou MUST generate the formatted reasoning trace with the following structure:\n\nQUESTION:\n<The original problem statement with text and image placeholders: <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>, <image_start>[problem_image_2]<image_end>, etc. Stay as close to the original problem statement as possible but remove noise to ensure clarity>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: <Clear description of initial reasoning step that identifies key elements of the problem>\nTHOUGHT 1: <Next reasoning step, often explaining why an image will be created>\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: <Further reasoning step based on the image, explaining insights gained>\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\n// Additional thoughts and images as needed\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_X]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT N: <Final reasoning step before the answer, summarizing key insights>\n\nFINAL ANSWER: \n<The final calculated answer based on the reasoning>\n\n=====================  Guidelines  =================\n\n1. Enhancing Original Trace Rather than Generating New Trace:\n  - Instead of generating a new trace, your task is to enhance the original trace (which is a correct trace but rather concise and lacks coherent multimodal reasoning) by adding more details and explanations, see the following sections of guidelines for more details.\n  - You MUST use all the images provided in the original trace.\n  - You should use the original trace as a reference rather than copying it verbatim.\n\n2. Multimodal Reasoning Flow:\n   - Develop a coherent, step-by-step chain of thought that seamlessly integrates textual and visual reasoning.\n   - Clearly explain the necessity of generating a sketch / visual thought / image before introducing its placeholder.\n   - After each image placeholder, describe the insights gained from the sketch / visual thought / image, and how it contributes to advancing the solution.\n   - Ensure each step logically builds on the previous ones, especially between text reasoning and visual reasoning\n   steps. \n   \n3. Image Placeholders and References:\n   - Use placeholder tags ONLY when you want to actually insert/show/generate an image in your trace. When doing so, write the corresponding placeholder tag exactly as shown, including the <image_start> and <image_end> tags.\n   - Each unique image in the original problem and the reasoning trace should be represented by a unique placeholder tag, and each unique placeholder tag should only show up once in the trace.\n   - When referring to images in your explanations, use natural language descriptions (e.g., \"the diagram in the question\", \"the first sketch\", \"the visual thought X I created\") instead of using placeholder tags. This is important because it helps us to parse into interleaved text and image sequences.\n   - For images from the original problem, use: <image_start>[problem_image_X]<image_end>\n   - For sketches or visuals generated during reasoning, use: <image_start>[reasoning_image_X]<image_end>\n\n4. Narrative Style:\n   - Remove irrelevant technical details such as debugging info, code snippets, and LaTeX package imports.\n   - Eliminate verbose language that do not contribute to solving the problem.\n   - Focus on the essential reasoning path that leads to the correct solution, using concise and clear language to describe the overall reasoning process.\n\n"

      "text": "QUESTION:\nTotal weight of a minimum spanning tree? [problem_image_1]\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nAlgorithm: Finding a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's algorithm.\nKruskal's algorithm builds the MST by considering edges in order of increasing weight and adding them if they don't create a cycle.\nWe sort all edges by weight and then process them one by one. Total edges to consider: 8.\nWe use a Union-Find data structure to efficiently detect cycles when adding edges.\nStep 1: Examining edge (2,4) with weight 4. Nodes 2 and 4 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4)], total weight=4. [reasoning_image_1] Progress: 1/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nStep 2: Examining edge (0,6) with weight 5. Nodes 0 and 6 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6)], total weight=9. [reasoning_image_2] Progress: 2/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nStep 3: Examining edge (0,1) with weight 6. Nodes 0 and 1 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1)], total weight=15. [reasoning_image_3] Progress: 3/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nStep 4: Examining edge (2,3) with weight 6. Nodes 2 and 3 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3)], total weight=21. [reasoning_image_4] Progress: 4/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nStep 5: Examining edge (5,6) with weight 6. Nodes 5 and 6 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6)], total weight=27. [reasoning_image_5] Progress: 5/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nStep 6: Examining edge (2,6) with weight 7. Nodes 2 and 6 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6), (2, 6)], total weight=34. [reasoning_image_6] Progress: 6/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nStep 7: Examining edge (1,5) with weight 9. Nodes 1 and 5 are already in the same connected component (according to Union-Find), so adding this edge would create a cycle, which is not allowed in a tree. Skipping this edge. [reasoning_image_7] Progress: 6/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nStep 8: Examining edge (2,7) with weight 9. Nodes 2 and 7 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)], total weight=43. [reasoning_image_8] Progress: 7/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.\nFinal MST: The minimum spanning tree has edges [(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)] with total weight 43.
