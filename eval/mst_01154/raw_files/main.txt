QUESTION:
Total weight of a minimum spanning tree? [problem_image_1]

REASONING TRACE:
Algorithm: Finding a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's algorithm.
Kruskal's algorithm builds the MST by considering edges in order of increasing weight and adding them if they don't create a cycle.
We sort all edges by weight and then process them one by one. Total edges to consider: 8.
We use a Union-Find data structure to efficiently detect cycles when adding edges.
Step 1: Examining edge (2,4) with weight 4. Nodes 2 and 4 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4)], total weight=4. [reasoning_image_1] Progress: 1/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Step 2: Examining edge (0,6) with weight 5. Nodes 0 and 6 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6)], total weight=9. [reasoning_image_2] Progress: 2/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Step 3: Examining edge (0,1) with weight 6. Nodes 0 and 1 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1)], total weight=15. [reasoning_image_3] Progress: 3/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Step 4: Examining edge (2,3) with weight 6. Nodes 2 and 3 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3)], total weight=21. [reasoning_image_4] Progress: 4/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Step 5: Examining edge (5,6) with weight 6. Nodes 5 and 6 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6)], total weight=27. [reasoning_image_5] Progress: 5/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Step 6: Examining edge (2,6) with weight 7. Nodes 2 and 6 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6), (2, 6)], total weight=34. [reasoning_image_6] Progress: 6/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Step 7: Examining edge (1,5) with weight 9. Nodes 1 and 5 are already in the same connected component (according to Union-Find), so adding this edge would create a cycle, which is not allowed in a tree. Skipping this edge. [reasoning_image_7] Progress: 6/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Step 8: Examining edge (2,7) with weight 9. Nodes 2 and 7 are in different connected components, so adding this edge won't create a cycle. Adding edge to MST. Updated MST edges=[(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)], total weight=43. [reasoning_image_8] Progress: 7/7 edges in MST. A complete MST needs exactly (n-1) edges where n is the number of nodes.
Final MST: The minimum spanning tree has edges [(2, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)] with total weight 43. [reasoning_image_9]

FINAL ANSWER:
43
