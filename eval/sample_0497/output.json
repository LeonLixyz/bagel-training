Identify which option correctly completes the puzzle. <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: Analyze the puzzle input to understand the shape and location of the missing pieces.\nTHOUGHT 1: Evaluate each option by mentally or visually placing its pieces into the gray areas of the puzzle. Let's start by testing option A.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: Observing the first visual thought, option A's pieces do not align correctly with the existing puzzle image. Next, let's test option B.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: The second visual thought shows that option B's pieces fit perfectly into the missing spaces, completing the image seamlessly. Let's continue checking other options to confirm.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_3]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 4: The third visual thought, showing option C, confirms that its pieces do not fit the puzzle's missing areas. Let's test the final option, D.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_4]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 5: The fourth visual thought demonstrates that option D's pieces also do not fit the required shapes in the puzzle.\nTHOUGHT 6: Based on the visual evaluation, only option B provides the correct pieces to complete the jigsaw puzzle.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nB",
