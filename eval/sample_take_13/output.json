  "response": "QUESTION: Starting with the objects shown in the image, perform the following sequence of operations: Step 1: Add 1 purple pyramid, 1 red cylinder, 1 orange capsule, 1 blue cone, and 1 purple dodecahedron. Step 2: Remove 1 orange capsule and 1 black capsule. Step 3: Remove 2 green spheres and 1 green cone. Step 4: Add 1 orange cylinder, 1 orange cone, 1 black pyramid, 1 red donut, 1 black sphere, and 1 orange pyramid. After all operations, how many purple objects remain? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: Analyze the initial state shown in the problem image. There are 7 objects: 1 black capsule, 1 green cone, 2 green spheres, 1 blue sphere, 1 blue dodecahedron, and 1 purple cube.\nTHOUGHT 1: Apply Step 1 by adding the specified objects. This results in a new collection of objects.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: Apply Step 2 by removing the orange and black capsules from the current set of objects.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: Apply Step 3 by removing the green spheres and green cone from the remaining objects.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_3]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 4: Apply Step 4 by adding the final set of objects. This is the final configuration.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_4]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 5: Count the number of purple objects in the final configuration shown in the last image. There is a purple cube, a purple pyramid, and a purple dodecahedron.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n3",
