  "response": "QUESTION: Starting with the objects shown in the image, perform the following operations: First, remove 2 red pyramids and 1 red cylinder. Second, add 1 black cube, 1 red donut, 1 blue cube, 1 blue cone, 1 purple capsule, and 1 blue dodecahedron. Third, add 1 red donut, 1 blue cube, 1 purple cone, 1 green sphere, 1 blue cone, and 1 black capsule. How many pyramids are there after these operations? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: Analyze the initial image and the sequence of operations. The problem asks for the final count of pyramids.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 1: The first operation is to remove 2 red pyramids and 1 red cylinder from the initial set. The image above shows the state after this step, where 4 pyramids remain.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: The second operation adds 6 objects: a black cube, red donut, blue cube, blue cone, purple capsule, and blue dodecahedron. No pyramids are added. The image above shows the state after this second step. There are still 4 pyramids.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_3]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: The third operation adds another 6 objects: a red donut, blue cube, purple cone, green sphere, blue cone, and black capsule. No pyramids are added in this step either. The image above shows the final state.\nTHOUGHT 4: Count the pyramids in the final state shown in the last image. There is 1 purple pyramid, 1 black pyramid, and 2 green pyramids.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n4",
