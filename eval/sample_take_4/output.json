  "response": "QUESTION: Starting with the objects shown in the initial image, perform the given sequence of operations: First, remove 1 green dodecahedron and 1 purple dodecahedron. Second, add 1 red pyramid, 1 purple dodecahedron, 1 black sphere, 1 purple donut, 1 orange pyramid, and 1 blue donut. Third, remove 1 black pyramid and 1 black sphere. How many objects remain in total after these steps? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: The initial image shows 5 objects: an orange cube, a brown cylinder, a green dodecahedron, a purple dodecahedron, and a black pyramid.\nTHOUGHT 1: Step 1 removes 1 green dodecahedron and 1 purple dodecahedron from the initial 5 objects. This leaves 3 objects. A visual shows the remaining objects.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: Step 2 adds 6 new objects: 1 red pyramid, 1 purple dodecahedron, 1 black sphere, 1 purple donut, 1 orange pyramid, and 1 blue donut. Adding these to the 3 objects from Step 1 results in 9 objects. The next visual shows the objects after these additions.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: Step 3 removes 1 black pyramid and 1 black sphere from the 9 objects. Removing these 2 objects leaves 7 objects. The final visual confirms the remaining objects.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_3]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 4: After performing all steps, the total number of objects is 7.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n7",
