<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>
THOUGHT 1: Removed 1 green dodecahedron. Removed 1 purple dodecahedron. Now there are 3 objects.
<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>
THOUGHT 2: Added 1 red pyramid. Added 1 purple dodecahedron. Added 1 black sphere. Added 1 purple donut. Added 1 orange pyramid. Added 1 blue donut. Now there are 9 objects.
