  "response": "QUESTION: Starting with the objects depicted in the image, perform the following sequence of operations: Step 1 involves removing 2 blue capsules and 1 blue donut. Step 2 requires adding 1 orange donut, 1 orange sphere, and 1 green dodecahedron. Step 3 consists of adding 1 orange donut, 1 red pyramid, 1 purple donut, 1 orange dodecahedron, and 1 green capsule. What is the final total number of objects? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: Begin with the initial state shown in the problem image. According to the problem's starting point, there are 11 objects initially.\nTHOUGHT 1: Execute the first set of operations: remove 2 blue capsules and 1 blue donut. The total number of objects is now 11 - 2 - 1 = 8. The first visual shows the scene after these items have been removed.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: Next, perform the additions from Step 2: add 1 orange donut, 1 orange sphere, and 1 green dodecahedron. The object count increases to 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11. The second visual depicts the scene after these objects are added.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: Finally, carry out the additions specified in Step 3: add 1 orange donut, 1 red pyramid, 1 purple donut, 1 orange dodecahedron, and 1 green capsule. The total count becomes 11 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16. The third visual shows the scene after all operations are complete.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_3]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 4: After performing all removals and additions as described in the steps, the final count of objects is 16.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n16",
