Note the presence of pyramids, cubes, a cylinder, a cone, and a dodecahedron.\nTHOUGHT 1: Apply the first removal step: remove 2 blue pyramids and 1 blue cube. Visualize the remaining objects. The following image shows the scene after these removals.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: Observe the objects remaining in the image after the first step. There is one purple pyramid, one red cube, one green cone, one orange cylinder, and one orange dodecahedron.\nTHOUGHT 3: Apply the second removal step: remove 1 purple pyramid. Visualize the final set of objects. The next image depicts the scene after this removal.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 4: Review the final image to count the number of dodecahedrons. The orange dodecahedron remains.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n1",
