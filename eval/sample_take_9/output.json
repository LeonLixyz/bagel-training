  "response": "QUESTION:\nStarting with the objects shown in the image, perform the following steps: Step 1: Remove 2 red spheres. Step 2: Add 1 red sphere, 1 orange donut, 1 blue dodecahedron, 1 red cube, 1 purple donut, and 1 green donut. Step 3: Remove 1 green sphere and 2 green donuts. Step 4: Remove 1 black sphere, 1 red sphere, and 1 purple sphere. How many dodecahedrons remain? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: Analyze the initial state shown in the problem image to identify the starting objects. There are 7 objects: 2 red spheres, 1 black sphere, 1 purple sphere, 1 green sphere, 1 blue cylinder, and 1 green donut.\nTHOUGHT 1: Apply Step 1: Remove 2 red spheres from the initial 7 objects. This leaves 5 objects. A visual representation helps track the remaining items.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: The first visual thought shows the 5 objects remaining after Step 1. Apply Step 2: Add 6 new objects (1 red sphere, 1 orange donut, 1 blue dodecahedron, 1 red cube, 1 purple donut, 1 green donut). The total number of objects is now 5 + 6 = 11. Let's visualize this new collection.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 3: The second visual thought displays the 11 objects after Step 2. Apply Step 3: Remove 1 green sphere and 2 green donuts. This removes a total of 3 objects, leaving 11 - 3 = 8 objects. A new visual helps confirm the state.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_3]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 4: The third visual thought shows the 8 objects after Step 3. Apply Step 4: Remove 1 black sphere, 1 red sphere, and 1 purple sphere. This removes 3 objects, resulting in 8 - 3 = 5 objects remaining. Let's see the final set of objects.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_4]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 5: The final visual thought shows the 5 objects remaining after all steps. Identify the types of objects present to answer the question about dodecahedrons. The objects are a blue cylinder, an orange donut, a blue dodecahedron, a red cube, and a purple donut.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n1",
