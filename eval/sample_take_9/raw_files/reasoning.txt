Step 3: Removed 1 green sphere. Removed 2 green donuts.
Step 4: Removed 1 black sphere. Removed 1 red sphere. Removed 1 purple sphere.
Then answer: How many dodecahedrons are there? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>

REASONING TRACE:
THOUGHT 0: Begin with 7 objects. I need to imagine from Front45 angle to get a better mental picture.
<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>
THOUGHT 1: Removed 2 red spheres. Now there are 5 objects.
<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>
THOUGHT 2: Added 1 red sphere. Added 1 orange donut. Added 1 blue dodecahedron. Added 1 red cube. Added 1 purple donut. Added 1 green donut. Now there are 11 objects.
<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>
THOUGHT 3: Removed 1 green sphere. Removed 2 green donuts. Now there are 8 objects.
<image_start>[reasoning_image_3]<image_end>
THOUGHT 4: Removed 1 black sphere. Removed 1 red sphere. Removed 1 purple sphere. Now there are 5 objects.
