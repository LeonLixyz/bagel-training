      "system_prompt": "You are an expert in creating clean and logically coherent multimodal chain of thought traces. Your task is to analyze\nand comprehend a raw reasoning trace with interleaved text and images, then transform it into a clean, step-by-step multimodal\nreasoning trace that correctly solves the original problem.\n\n========================  INPUT  ========================\n1. Problem & Noisy Trace: A raw interleaved text and image reasoning trace. Images in this trace are represented by placeholders:\n   - `[problem_image_X]` for original problem images (e.g., `[problem_image_1]`, `[problem_image_2]`)\n   - `[reasoning_image_X]` for images generated during reasoning (e.g., `[reasoning_image_1]`, `[reasoning_image_2]`)\n2. Image Data: The actual image data corresponding to the placeholders, provided separately.\n\n=====================  Your Task  =================\nGenerate a clean, logical multimodal reasoning trace as **plain text** that represents the *ideal* reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n=====================  OUTPUT FORMAT  ===================\nYou MUST generate the formatted reasoning trace with the following structure:\n\nQUESTION:\n<The original problem statement with text and image placeholders: <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>, <image_start>[problem_image_2]<image_end>, etc. Stay as close to the original problem statement as possible but remove noise to ensure clarity>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: <Clear description of initial reasoning step that identifies key elements of the problem>\nTHOUGHT 1: <Next reasoning step, often explaining why an image will be created>\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: <Further reasoning step based on the image, explaining insights gained>\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_2]<image_end>\n// Additional thoughts and images as needed\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_X]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT N: <Final reasoning step before the answer, summarizing key insights>\n\nFINAL ANSWER: \n<The final calculated answer based on the reasoning>\n\n=====================  Guidelines  =================\n\n1. Enhancing Original Trace Rather than Generating New Trace:\n  - Instead of generating a new trace, your task is to enhance the original trace (which is a correct trace but rather concise and lacks coherent multimodal reasoning) by adding more details and explanations, see the following sections of guidelines for more details.\n  - You MUST use all the images provided in the original trace.\n  - You should use the original trace as a reference rather than copying it verbatim.\n\n2. Multimodal Reasoning Flow:\n   - Develop a coherent, step-by-step chain of thought that seamlessly integrates textual and visual reasoning.\n   - Clearly explain the necessity of generating a sketch / visual thought / image before introducing its placeholder.\n   - After each image placeholder, describe the insights gained from the sketch / visual thought / image, and how it contributes to advancing the solution.\n   - Ensure each step logically builds on the previous ones, especially between text reasoning and visual reasoning\n   steps. \n   \n3. Image Placeholders and References:\n   - Use placeholder tags ONLY when you want to actually insert/show/generate an image in your trace. When doing so, write the corresponding placeholder tag exactly as shown, including the <image_start> and <image_end> tags.\n   - Each unique image in the original problem and the reasoning trace should be represented by a unique placeholder tag, and each unique placeholder tag should only show up once in the trace.\n   - When referring to images in your explanations, use natural language descriptions (e.g., \"the diagram in the question\", \"the first sketch\", \"the visual thought X I created\") instead of using placeholder tags. This is important because it helps us to parse into interleaved text and image sequences.\n   - For images from the original problem, use: <image_start>[problem_image_X]<image_end>\n   - For sketches or visuals generated during reasoning, use: <image_start>[reasoning_image_X]<image_end>\n\n4. Narrative Style:\n   - Remove irrelevant technical details such as debugging info, code snippets, and LaTeX package imports.\n   - Eliminate verbose language that do not contribute to solving the problem.\n   - Focus on the essential reasoning path that leads to the correct solution, using concise and clear language to describe the overall reasoning process.\n\n"

[problem_image_1]\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nAlgorithm: Finding shortest path from 3 to 5 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\nDijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.\nInitialize distances: node 3 is 0, all others are infinity. We use a Priority Queue (PQ) to process nodes in order of increasing distance.\nPQ starts with [(0, 3)], where the first element is the distance, and the second is the node.\nStep 0: Initial state. Start node 3 highlighted. Distances: {0: '\u221e', 1: '\u221e', 2: '\u221e', 3: 0, 4: '\u221e', 5: '\u221e', 6: '\u221e', 7: '\u221e'}. PQ: [(0, 3)]. [reasoning_image_1]\nStep 1.A: Popped (0, 3) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [].\nStep 1.B: Finalized shortest distance to 3 as 0. Path: [3]. Finalized set: {3}. Distances: {0: '\u221e', 1: '\u221e', 2: '\u221e', 3: 0, 4: '\u221e', 5: '\u221e', 6: '\u221e', 7: '\u221e'}. [reasoning_image_2]\nStep 1.C: From 3, examining neighbor 0 (edge (3,0) weight 8). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 0 via 3 is 0 + 8 = 8. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(0) to 8, prev(0) to 3. Added (8, 0) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(8, 0)]. Distances: {0: 8, 1: '\u221e', 2: '\u221e', 3: 0, 4: '\u221e', 5: '\u221e', 6: '\u221e', 7: '\u221e'}. [reasoning_image_3]\nStep 1.D: From 3, examining neighbor 4 (edge (3,4) weight 6). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 4 via 3 is 0 + 6 = 6. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(4) to 6, prev(4) to 3. Added (6, 4) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(6, 4), (8, 0)]. Distances: {0: 8, 1: '\u221e', 2: '\u221e', 3: 0, 4: 6, 5: '\u221e', 6: '\u221e', 7: '\u221e'}.

Node 3 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.\nStep 2.D: From 4, examining neighbor 5 (edge (4,5) weight 3). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 5 via 4 is 6 + 3 = 9. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(5) to 9, prev(5) to 4. Added (9, 5) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(8, 0), (9, 5)]. Distances: {0: 8, 1: '\u221e', 2: '\u221e', 3: 0, 4: 6, 5: 9, 6: '\u221e', 7: '\u221e'}. [reasoning_image_6]\nStep 2.E: From 4, examining neighbor 6 (edge (4,6) weight 1). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 6 via 4 is 6 + 1 = 7. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(6) to 7, prev(6) to 4. Added (7, 6) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(7, 6), (8, 0), (9, 5)].

Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 1 via 6 is 7 + 8 = 15. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(1) to 15, prev(1) to 6. Added (15, 1) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(8, 0), (9, 5), (15, 1)].

Node 4 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.\nStep 4.A: Popped (8, 0) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [(9, 5), (15, 1)].\nStep 4.B: Finalized shortest distance to 0 as 8. Path: [3, 0]. Finalized set: {0, 3, 4, 6}. Distances: {0: 8, 1: 15, 2: '\u221e', 3: 0, 4: 6, 5: 9, 6: 7, 7: '\u221e'}. [reasoning_image_10]\nStep 4.C: From 0, examining neighbor 2 (edge (0,2) weight 2). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 2 via 0 is 8 + 2 = 10. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(2) to 10, prev(2) to 0. Added (10, 2) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(9, 5), (10, 2), (15, 1)]. Distances: {0: 8, 1: 15, 2: 10, 3: 0, 4: 6, 5: 9, 6: 7, 7: '\u221e'}.

Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [(10, 2), (15, 1)].\nStep 5.B: Finalized shortest distance to 5 as 9. Path: [3, 4, 5].

This means we've found the shortest path to our target node. When using Dijkstra's algorithm, once a node is finalized, its distance is guaranteed to be optimal.\nFinal shortest path from 3 to 5: [3, 4, 5], with total distance 9.
