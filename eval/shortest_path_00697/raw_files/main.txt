QUESTION:
Shortest path from 2 to 5? [problem_image_1]

REASONING TRACE:
Algorithm: Finding shortest path from 2 to 5 using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.
Initialize distances: node 2 is 0, all others are infinity. We use a Priority Queue (PQ) to process nodes in order of increasing distance.
PQ starts with [(0, 2)], where the first element is the distance, and the second is the node.
Step 0: Initial state. Start node 2 highlighted. Distances: {0: '∞', 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: '∞', 4: '∞', 5: '∞', 6: '∞'}. PQ: [(0, 2)]. [reasoning_image_1]
Step 1.A: Popped (0, 2) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [].
Step 1.B: Finalized shortest distance to 2 as 0. Path: [2]. Finalized set: {2}. Distances: {0: '∞', 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: '∞', 4: '∞', 5: '∞', 6: '∞'}. [reasoning_image_2]
Step 1.C: From 2, examining neighbor 0 (edge (2,0) weight 6). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 0 via 2 is 0 + 6 = 6. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(0) to 6, prev(0) to 2. Added (6, 0) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(6, 0)]. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: '∞', 4: '∞', 5: '∞', 6: '∞'}. [reasoning_image_3]
Step 1.D: From 2, examining neighbor 3 (edge (2,3) weight 5). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 3 via 2 is 0 + 5 = 5. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(3) to 5, prev(3) to 2. Added (5, 3) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(5, 3), (6, 0)]. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: '∞', 5: '∞', 6: '∞'}. [reasoning_image_4]
Step 1.E: From 2, examining neighbor 6 (edge (2,6) weight 3). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 6 via 2 is 0 + 3 = 3. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(6) to 3, prev(6) to 2. Added (3, 6) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(3, 6), (5, 3), (6, 0)]. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: '∞', 5: '∞', 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_5]
Step 2.A: Popped (3, 6) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [(5, 3), (6, 0)].
Step 2.B: Finalized shortest distance to 6 as 3. Path: [2, 6]. Finalized set: {2, 6}. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: '∞', 5: '∞', 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_6]
Step 2.C: From 6, examining neighbor 2. Node 2 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.
Step 2.D: From 6, examining neighbor 4 (edge (6,4) weight 5). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 4 via 6 is 3 + 5 = 8. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(4) to 8, prev(4) to 6. Added (8, 4) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(5, 3), (6, 0), (8, 4)]. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: '∞', 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_7]
Step 3.A: Popped (5, 3) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [(6, 0), (8, 4)].
Step 3.B: Finalized shortest distance to 3 as 5. Path: [2, 3]. Finalized set: {2, 3, 6}. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: '∞', 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_8]
Step 3.C: From 3, examining neighbor 2. Node 2 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.
Step 3.D: From 3, examining neighbor 5 (edge (3,5) weight 9). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 5 via 3 is 5 + 9 = 14. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(5) to 14, prev(5) to 3. Added (14, 5) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(6, 0), (8, 4), (14, 5)]. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: 14, 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_9]
Step 4.A: Popped (6, 0) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [(8, 4), (14, 5)].
Step 4.B: Finalized shortest distance to 0 as 6. Path: [2, 0]. Finalized set: {0, 2, 3, 6}. Distances: {0: 6, 1: '∞', 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: 14, 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_10]
Step 4.C: From 0, examining neighbor 1 (edge (0,1) weight 5). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 1 via 0 is 6 + 5 = 11. This is better than current distance (infinity), so we update. Updated dist(1) to 11, prev(1) to 0. Added (11, 1) to PQ. This is called 'relaxation' in graph algorithms. PQ now: [(8, 4), (11, 1), (14, 5)]. Distances: {0: 6, 1: 11, 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: 14, 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_11]
Step 4.D: From 0, examining neighbor 2. Node 2 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.
Step 5.A: Popped (8, 4) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [(11, 1), (14, 5)].
Step 5.B: Finalized shortest distance to 4 as 8. Path: [2, 6, 4]. Finalized set: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}. Distances: {0: 6, 1: 11, 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: 14, 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_12]
Step 5.C: From 4, examining neighbor 1 (edge (4,1) weight 5). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 1 via 4 is 8 + 5 = 13. This is not better than current distance (11), so no update needed for 1 via 4. The algorithm only updates distances when a shorter path is found.
Step 5.D: From 4, examining neighbor 6. Node 6 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.
Step 6.A: Popped (11, 1) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [(14, 5)].
Step 6.B: Finalized shortest distance to 1 as 11. Path: [2, 0, 1]. Finalized set: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. Distances: {0: 6, 1: 11, 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: 14, 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_13]
Step 6.C: From 1, examining neighbor 0. Node 0 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.
Step 6.D: From 1, examining neighbor 4. Node 4 is already finalized, so its shortest distance cannot be improved. Skipping.
Step 6.E: From 1, examining neighbor 5 (edge (1,5) weight 6). Dijkstra's checks if the path through current node improves the distance. Tentative distance to 5 via 1 is 11 + 6 = 17. This is not better than current distance (14), so no update needed for 5 via 1. The algorithm only updates distances when a shorter path is found.
Step 7.A: Popped (14, 5) from PQ. Dijkstra's always processes the unvisited node with smallest distance next. Current PQ: [].
Step 7.B: Finalized shortest distance to 5 as 14. Path: [2, 3, 5]. Finalized set: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Distances: {0: 6, 1: 11, 2: 0, 3: 5, 4: 8, 5: 14, 6: 3}. [reasoning_image_14]
Step 7.C: Goal node 5 reached and finalized. This means we've found the shortest path to our target node. When using Dijkstra's algorithm, once a node is finalized, its distance is guaranteed to be optimal.
Final shortest path from 2 to 5: [2, 3, 5], with total distance 14. [reasoning_image_15]

FINAL ANSWER:
Length=14; path=[2, 3, 5]
