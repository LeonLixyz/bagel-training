QUESTION:
Provide a valid topological order. [problem_image_1]

REASONING TRACE:
Algorithm: Finding a topological ordering using Kahn's algorithm.
A topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge (u,v), node u comes before node v in the ordering.
Kahn's algorithm works by repeatedly removing nodes with zero in-degree (nodes with no incoming edges) and their outgoing edges.
When we remove a node and its edges, other nodes may become zero in-degree and eligible for removal.
Initial zero in-degree nodes: [1, 0, 4]. These have no dependencies and can be processed first.
Step 1: Removed node 0 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0]. Removed outgoing edges from 0 to [3] and decremented their in-degrees. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [1, 4]. [reasoning_image_1]
Step 2: Removed node 1 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 1]. Removed outgoing edges from 1 to [2] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [2]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [2, 4]. [reasoning_image_2]
Step 3: Removed node 2 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 1, 2]. Removed outgoing edges from 2 to [3] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [3]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [3, 4]. [reasoning_image_3]
Step 4: Removed node 3 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 1, 2, 3]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [4]. [reasoning_image_4]
Step 5: Removed node 4 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: []. [reasoning_image_5]
Completed topological sort. All 5 nodes are included in the order, confirming the graph is acyclic.
Final topological sort: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The nodes are arranged from left to right in topological order. [reasoning_image_6]

FINAL ANSWER:
0-1-2-3-4
