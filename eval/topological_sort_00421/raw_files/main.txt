Algorithm: Finding a topological ordering using Kahn's algorithm.
A topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge (u,v), node u comes before node v in the ordering.
Kahn's algorithm works by repeatedly removing nodes with zero in-degree (nodes with no incoming edges) and their outgoing edges.
When we remove a node and its edges, other nodes may become zero in-degree and eligible for removal.
Initial zero in-degree nodes: [6, 0, 2, 3, 4]. These have no dependencies and can be processed first.
Step 1: Removed node 0 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0]. Removed outgoing edges from 0 to [5] and decremented their in-degrees. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [2, 3, 4, 6]. [reasoning_image_1]
Step 2: Removed node 2 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 2]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [3, 4, 6]. [reasoning_image_2]
Step 3: Removed node 3 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 2, 3]. Removed outgoing edges from 3 to [7, 5, 1] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [7]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [4, 6, 7]. [reasoning_image_3]
Step 4: Removed node 4 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 2, 3, 4]. Removed outgoing edges from 4 to [5] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [5]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [5, 6, 7]. [reasoning_image_4]
Step 5: Removed node 5 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [6, 7]. [reasoning_image_5]
Step 6: Removed node 6 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Removed outgoing edges from 6 to [1] and decremented their in-degrees. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [7]. [reasoning_image_6]
Step 7: Removed node 7 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Removed outgoing edges from 7 to [1] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [1]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [1]. [reasoning_image_7]
Step 8: Removed node 1 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: []. [reasoning_image_8]
Completed topological sort. All 8 nodes are included in the order, confirming the graph is acyclic.
Final topological sort: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1]. The nodes are arranged from left to right in topological order. [reasoning_image_9]

FINAL ANSWER:
0-2-3-4-5-6-7-1
