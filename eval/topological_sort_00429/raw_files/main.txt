Provide a valid topological order. [problem_image_1]

REASONING TRACE:
Algorithm: Finding a topological ordering using Kahn's algorithm.
A topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge (u,v), node u comes before node v in the ordering.
Kahn's algorithm works by repeatedly removing nodes with zero in-degree (nodes with no incoming edges) and their outgoing edges.
When we remove a node and its edges, other nodes may become zero in-degree and eligible for removal.
Initial zero in-degree nodes: [5, 3]. These have no dependencies and can be processed first.
Step 1: Removed node 3 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [3]. Removed outgoing edges from 3 to [1, 4, 6] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [1]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [1, 5]. [reasoning_image_1]
Step 2: Removed node 1 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [3, 1]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [5]. [reasoning_image_2]
Step 3: Removed node 5 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [3, 1, 5]. Removed outgoing edges from 5 to [4, 2, 0] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [2, 4]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [2, 4]. [reasoning_image_3]
Step 4: Removed node 2 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [3, 1, 5, 2]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: [4]. [reasoning_image_4]
Step 5: Removed node 4 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]. Removed outgoing edges from 4 to [0, 6] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [0]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [0]. [reasoning_image_5]
Step 6: Removed node 0 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 0]. Removed outgoing edges from 0 to [6] and decremented their in-degrees. Nodes that now have zero in-degree: [6]. These are added to the zero in-degree list: [6]. [reasoning_image_6]
Step 7: Removed node 6 from the zero in-degree list and added it to our topological order. Current order: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 6]. No nodes became zero in-degree in this step. Current zero in-degree list: []. [reasoning_image_7]
Completed topological sort. All 7 nodes are included in the order, confirming the graph is acyclic.
Final topological sort: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 6]. The nodes are arranged from left to right in topological order. [reasoning_image_8]

FINAL ANSWER:
3-1-5-2-4-0-6
