  "response": "QUESTION:\nHow is the bus in the image parked? <image_start>[problem_image_1]<image_end>\n\nREASONING TRACE:\nTHOUGHT 0: The question asks about the parking orientation of the bus shown in the image.\nTHOUGHT 1: To determine how the bus is parked, I need to look closely at which end of the bus is visible and its position relative to the apparent direction of travel or a road. I will focus on the rear of the bus.\n<image_start>[reasoning_image_1]<image_end>\nTHOUGHT 2: The zoomed-in image clearly shows the back of the bus, indicated by the taillights and rear bumper area.\nTHOUGHT 3: Since the rear of the bus is visible from this perspective, the bus must be parked facing away from the viewer, towards what would be the road or direction of travel.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nFacing the road.",
